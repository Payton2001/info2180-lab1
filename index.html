        AS you can see my name is Shadean. I enjoy reading in my spare type.
        In the future I wish to travel to all the countries in the world. I
        choose to study web Development because I think its the foundation to all
        things internet related. Additionally, I feel that learning Wb Development
        will make a better software developer as I will have a better unerstanding of
        how the web operate; thus making it easier to deploy application created in the
        future.
